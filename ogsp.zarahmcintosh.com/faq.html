                            	Absolutely.  They are high energy without a doubt, but can adjust to most lifestyles 
                            	with enough physical and mental stimulation. They need daily exercise.  Having a fenced yard 
                            	is for your own benefit since they can pretty much exercise themselves, given enough room to romp.  
                            	Unless you are truly an active person, a fenced yard that they can run freely in, 
                            	a few hours a day is necessary at a minimum.  We have a hot wire top and bottom to 
                            	prevent them from digging and climbing over.  GSPs are very driven dogs.  They are bred to be this way.

                            	<p> Spaying/neutering does have it's benefits BUT you should know the consequences also.  
	                            	It does take care of them from reproducing but there is too much 
	                            	information that points to the cancer causing effects from the imbalance in hormones
	                            	and other diseases caused by "fixing".  Modified spays (if you're lucky to find a vet 
	                            	that even does this) and keeping the males intact actually prevents certain cancers and is proven to prolong life expectancy.
	                            </p>

	                            	A truly responsible owner wouldn't have accidental breedings or get their dogs in any situation that my cause a fight.  
	                            	A responsible owner is always vigilant about the environment their dogs are in.  They know their temperaments and behavior under certain conditions
	                            	and know how to respond.  I've had both of mine, male and female, unfixed, for years, with no issues, and in many social (offleash dog parks, hunt tests, etc) situations.  
	                            	It takes some forethought, some work, like any other situation does.  Both neutered and un-neutered dogs can and will fight.  
	                            	The myths about aggression due to not being fixed is more of a temperament, control and owner responsibility issue.
	                            	Fixed dogs are not immune to showing un-desired behavior.

	                            	Dogs, especially males, are known to suffer from being fixed.  I would prefer all Olympic GSP pups 
	                            	to not ever be fixed and be with responsible families.  I don't require companion dogs to be "fixed" 
	                            	but you'll need to know how thoughtful and responsible you can be for your dog.  
	                            	I might not stop you from spaying or neutering your companion dog BUT there are hefty 
	                            	fines in the contract for any un-approved breeding, so be aware now. 
	                            	I will leave it as a personal decision because it affects the long term health of your dog and you know
	                            	yourself best in how responsible you can be for this pet.

								<p>
									We assess at 6.5 - 7.5 weeks. People can place reservation fees but no guarantee on a pup 
									since we really don't know the outcome until assessments are done and with other breeders 
									involved in the judging. If a pup does not become available for the person reserving then 
									they can either get money back, of course, or keep it in for a future breeding. Until all 
									have been assessed, we can't guarantee any of the pups to any home. We will always have 
									first pick, then proven show breeders pick, then show homes, then companion. If there is 
									a pup or pups available/offered to the person that paid a reservation a fee and they decline, 
									they lose the reservation fee. We match the pup with the home, knowing their personalities.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									The benefit of reserving is to let us know you are truly serious and very interested.  The reservation 
									fee holds your placement in the order of the selection process.  Until a reservation fee is paid, 
									the pups that do become available can not be reserved.  
								</p>
								<p>
									We take reservation fees at any time.  Reservation fee is $250 and becomes set specific to the breeding 
									of your choosing.  The fee is also applied to the purchase price of the puppy.  
									If you feel strongly about specifics like coat color and sex of the pup, you may provide 
									those preferences on your the reservation.  For example:  "I'd like a solid liver Male."

                            	For this breed it is necessary.  Broken tails are very hard to heal and cause dogs 
                            	and owners un-neccessary stress.  Tail docking is done at 3 - 5 days old and they are 
                            	more in complaint of being restrained than the actual procedure.  The nerves have not yet 
                            	completely developed and they have short memory during this early stage.  It is the best time to do it.
